## Game Instructions

This is a classical memory game with 16 cards. The cards will turn open if you click on them. If the symbols match, they will stay open. Otherwise the cards will turn back. 
The goal of the game is it to remember the symbols position and find all matching cards in as little moves as possible.

## Sources
